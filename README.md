DocAssist: Building an Intelligent Medical Decision Support System
Overview
DocAssist is an intelligent medical decision support system designed to assist doctors in making informed decisions about treatment options based on patient data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the system predicts treatment outcomes and recommends personalized treatment plans based on individual patient data, such as medical history, lab results, and other relevant factors.

Features
Data Collection: Collect patient data from electronic health records (EHRs) and medical databases.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess patient data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
Feature Engineering: Extract and transform features (such as age, sex, lab results) to make them suitable for machine learning models.
Treatment Recommendations: Predict treatment outcomes based on patient data and recommend suitable treatment options.
Model Interpretability: Provide interpretability of the machine learning models to help doctors understand why a recommendation was made.
User Interface: User-friendly interface for doctors to input patient data and receive treatment recommendations.
Technologies Used
Flask: Web framework for creating the web interface.
Python: Main programming language.
pandas: Data preprocessing and manipulation.
scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms.
joblib: For saving and loading trained models.
xgboost: Machine learning model (if used).
matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the following features:

HAEMATOCRIT: Hematocrit level
HAEMOGLOBIN: Hemoglobin level
ERYTHROCYTE: Red blood cells count
LEUCOCYTE: White blood cells count
THROMBOCYTE: Platelet count
MCH: Mean corpuscular hemoglobin
MCHC: Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration
MCV: Mean corpuscular volume
AGE: Patient's age
SEX: Patient's sex
SOURCE: Target variable for predicting treatment outcomes
Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
cd docassist
2. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies from the requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Flask Application
Start the Flask web app:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start a local server, usually at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

4. Access the Web Interface
Open a web browser and go to the following URL:

arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
The web page will allow you to input patient data and receive treatment recommendations.

5. Model Training
For the model training, the train_model.py script can be used to train the machine learning models based on the preprocessed data.

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
This script will train several machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) and save the best-performing model to a file using joblib.

6. Model Usage
The trained model is loaded in the Flask app to make predictions when a doctor inputs patient data.

Model Evaluation and Performance
The models used for predicting treatment outcomes are evaluated based on several metrics:

Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions.
Precision: The proportion of positive results that are true positives.
Recall: The proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified.
F1-Score: The balance between precision and recall.
Future Work
Explainable AI (XAI): Implement techniques like SHAP or LIME to provide better interpretability of the model.
Integration with Healthcare Systems: Integrate the decision support system with existing healthcare IT infrastructure for real-world deployment.
Patient Feedback: Incorporate patient feedback to improve the recommendations over time.
